❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a + b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` does not declare or receive any parameters (arguments). As a result, `a` and `b` are likely
referencing variables in the global scope (or will result in `ReferenceError` if they don't exist).
* ❌ The function has no JSDoc comments explaining what it does or what parameters it expects.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
* @param {number} a The first number.
* @param {number} b The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b){
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ Now the function explicitly takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, making its purpose and usage clear.
* ✔ Added JSDoc comments to clearly document the function's purpose, parameters, and return value. This is crucial for
maintainability and understandability.
* ✔ The code now correctly calculates and returns the sum of the input parameters.
